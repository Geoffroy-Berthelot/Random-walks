# Random walks on infinite graphs (/lattice) on multiple dimensions
This is the C++ code used for simulating random walks on infinite graphs (/lattice):
- only one random walker
- waiting time : the walker stops an amount of time \delta_h at each node/site
- waiting speed : the walker's speed
- perturbations (optional) including jumps, drift, short-term memory (the walker avoids returning to its precious node/site ), "empty" graph (/lattice) where each node has a probability to be already visited at initialization.
